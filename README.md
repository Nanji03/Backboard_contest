Elderly Care Companion is a web-based AI assistant that helps elderly users and their caregivers manage daily health tasks in a simple, safe way.  
The **goal** is to reduce missed medications and forgotten appointments, while making health information easier to understand for non‑technical, older adults.

Core objectives:
- Let a caregiver enter and update the senior’s medication schedule and upcoming appointments.
- Give the senior a simple chat interface to:
  - Ask “What do I take this morning?” or “When is my next doctor visit?”.
  - Receive friendly reminders at the right times.
- Allow pasting text from medical reports (e.g., blood test summary) and get a **plain‑language explanation** plus a reminder to discuss details with their doctor, not to replace medical advice.
